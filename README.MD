 Number Theory in Code

This repository is my personal playground for implementing **number theory algorithms** in code.

I’m focusing on writing **practical programs**, not just solving textbook exercises — starting from simple things like **GCD** and moving towards more advanced topics like **RSA** and maybe even building a tiny **toy programming language** based on number theory concepts.

> Languages used: **Currently JavaScript (Node.js), with plans to add Java implementations in the future.**

## 🚀 Goals

- Implement core **number theory algorithms** as real, runnable programs.
- Understand the theory by **coding it**, not just reading it.
- Build a small collection of tools that can grow over time:
